// Encapsulation: Encapsulate related data and methods into a single unit (class) and control access to that unit.

// Abstraction: Hide the complex implementation details and show only the essential features of the object.

// Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.

// Polymorphism: Refers to the ability of a method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon.

// Let's create a simple program demonstrating these concepts:

// Encapsulation: We'll create a Car class which encapsulates the properties and behavior of a car.

class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Inheritance: We'll create a subclass ElectricCar which inherits from the Car class.

class ElectricCar extends Car {
    private int batteryCapacity;

    public ElectricCar(String brand, String model, int year, int batteryCapacity) {
        super(brand, model, year);
        this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;
    }

    @Override
    public void displayDetails() {
        super.displayDetails();
        System.out.println("Battery Capacity: " + batteryCapacity + " kWh");
    }
}

// Polymorphism: We'll create a method that accepts both Car and ElectricCar objects and demonstrates polymorphic behavior.

class CarDisplay {
    public static void displayCarDetails(Car car) {
        car.displayDetails();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
        ElectricCar car2 = new ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", 2023, 100);

        // Abstraction: We interact with the Car and ElectricCar objects without knowing their internal implementations.
        CarDisplay.displayCarDetails(car1);
        CarDisplay.displayCarDetails(car2);
    }
}
