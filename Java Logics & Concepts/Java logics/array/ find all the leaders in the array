You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.
Examples:
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

Int[] arr={16,17,4,3,2};
Int n=arr.length;
Int max=arr[n-1];
s.o.p(max);
//check elements from right to left
for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
if(arr[i]>=max){
max=arr[i];
s.o.p(max);
}}
