Input --> i have a cat and his name is tom
Output --> I Have A Cat And His Name Is TOM
 String s = "i have a cat and his name is tom";
        String[] w = s.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {
            w[i] = Character.toUpperCase(w[i].charAt(0)) + w[i].substring(1);
        }
        System.out.println(String.join(" ", w));
split(" ") → breaks the string into words
Character.toUpperCase(w[i].charAt(0)) → makes the first letter capital
substring(1) → keeps the rest of the word the same
String.join(" ", w) → joins the words back into one sentence
